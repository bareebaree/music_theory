# This project uses network graphs to interactively explore chord changes using neo-Riemannian theory tonnetz

Chords are linked by a level of difference, given as a parameter, and transitionary pathways between them defined by level of difference are highlighted

Initial proof of concept is a non interactive graph that demonstrates network transitions between chords.
